5.64632E+17,Non-offensive,@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful.

5.64669E+17,Non-offensive,"Verified accts for all is an OK idea, but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways, which I've talked about in the past."
5.64669E+17,Non-offensive,verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have.
5.6467E+17,Non-offensive,"however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
5.6467E+17,Non-offensive,the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata.
5.6467E+17,Non-offensive,"add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch)."
5.6467E+17,Non-offensive,does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update.
5.64671E+17,Non-offensive,"phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse."
5.64671E+17,Non-offensive,"in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect."
5.64672E+17,Non-offensive,"don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA"" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3"
5.64672E+17,Non-offensive,@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV.
5.64672E+17,Non-offensive,@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.
5.64672E+17,Non-offensive,"@dominictarason i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago, talked about it here a month ago (neener). :P"
5.64672E+17,Non-offensive,@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV?
5.64673E+17,Non-offensive,@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS.
5.64673E+17,Non-offensive,@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required.
5.64673E+17,Non-offensive,@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #.
5.64674E+17,Non-offensive,it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity.
5.64674E+17,Non-offensive,pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE
5.64674E+17,Non-offensive,go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed.
5.64674E+17,Non-offensive,*whispers* hey guys. being free from abuse/harassment doesn't have to be monetized. it should be for everyone. i can show you the way.

5.64675E+17,Non-offensive,@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter.

5.64675E+17,Non-offensive,@eDRoaCH @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope.
5.64676E+17,Non-offensive,"@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad."
5.64676E+17,Non-offensive,i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts.
5.64676E+17,Non-offensive,"@eDRoaCH i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner, which is diff from their original purpose."
5.64676E+17,Non-offensive,@teh_maxh still extra work to go through. most trolls move on and find new victims.

5.64679E+17,Non-offensive,"@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side, though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category."
5.64679E+17,Non-offensive,"@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging businesses, just individuals."
5.64679E+17,Non-offensive,"@tomdcc multiple gmail accts. this is all a lot of effort, though. most trolls just pick a new target."
5.64679E+17,Non-offensive,"@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect, but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment."
5.64679E+17,Non-offensive,@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service.
5.64679E+17,Non-offensive,@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data.
5.64679E+17,Non-offensive,@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash.
5.6468E+17,Non-offensive,"@Spacekatgal $1 may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the US, but we're also far removed from the class it would impact."
5.6468E+17,Non-offensive,@Spacekatgal 80% of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint. no harassment on fbook? pft. providing ID/addy? NOPE.

5.64681E+17,Non-offensive,"@GlennF @Spacekatgal he's regurgitating the same ideas that people have had before. they were bad then, shockingly, still bad now."

5.64681E+17,Non-offensive,@tomdcc i met with them weeks ago. :P  who knows what they might do? i certainly don't. but we're talking.
5.64681E+17,Non-offensive,@sschinke @teh_maxh it sets a bad precedent.

5.70794E+17,Non-offensive,I'm still not 100% certain this is happening. But the delay between sending a tweet and seeing it appear is far too long.

5.70816E+17,Non-offensive,There is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti-harassment. He has defended GamerGate in the past.
5.70816E+17,Non-offensive,"At this moment in time, I am unaware of any effort he has made into this space. I'm tied in w/many orgs. His name has never once come up."
5.70816E+17,Non-offensive,He's been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute. He's utilized none of this. I am unimpressed.

5.70818E+17,Non-offensive,"I'm talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment, but do nothing beyond get RTed."
5.70819E+17,Non-offensive,"For everyone that is involved in this space, there's a huge personal risk. People get targeted. Friends and family get targeted."
5.70819E+17,Non-offensive,"Frankly, it's a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say ""I'm gonna do stuff!"" and then... do nothing."
5.70819E+17,Non-offensive,"Or, well, something happened. A hashtag was started by harassers to support him. So, that's something. I guess."
5.70819E+17,Non-offensive,"@GavinRamblesOn tbh, i feel bad anytime anyone actively enters this fight without knowing about the personal cost."
5.70819E+17,Non-offensive,@a_man_in_black I'm not mentioning names for a few different reasons.
5.7082E+17,Non-offensive,"@tpstigers it depends on how you define meaningful. if 3 people listen to you vs 30k, there's a huge difference in voice."
5.7082E+17,Non-offensive,@tpstigers completely disagree. it's industry recognition.
5.70821E+17,Non-offensive,"@tpstigers as someone that went from ~4k followers to what i've got now, i've seen a huge difference."

5.70834E+17,Non-offensive,@KaitlynBurnell the use of the word 'bully' in this context is worrisome and relevant to any conversation i have.
5.70834E+17,Non-offensive,"@KaitlynBurnell given the *massive* glee i'm seeing from GG irt that tweet, it's concerning that he's not retracting or explaining 'bully'"

5.71743E+17,Non-offensive,And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself.
5.71743E+17,Non-offensive,It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired.

5.72502E+17,Non-offensive,@Jason_Gio this is the same dude that thinks that not being allowed to publish an article to a site he doesn't own is "silencing"
5.72502E+17,Non-offensive,@Jason_Gio so his opinion on being blocked on twitter is probably fairly predictable.

5.73265E+17,Non-offensive,Listening to @twoscooters talk about how harassment is important. And how we are going to help you through it.
5.73266E+17,Non-offensive,"""I'm bringing it up for one reason. GamerGate has brought harassment into the limelight, but rest assured, it's always there."""
5.73266E+17,Non-offensive,"This is a problem that affects everyone, but we have seen far more harassment targeting women."
5.73266E+17,Non-offensive,It is fitting that we are now seeing these strong women speaking out and trying to fix problems that others are uncertain of how to tackle.

5.73269E+17,Non-offensive,"Online harassment is something most people have faced at some point, regardless of their views on ethics in games journalism."
5.73269E+17,Non-offensive,"It's a really tough problem, because it's a BIG problem. It is far reaching. It has many different forms."
5.7327E+17,Non-offensive,"The scope of the problem can discourage people from trying to fight it. Often this leads to thinking, ""what can I do? I'm just one person."""
5.7327E+17,Non-offensive,"You aren't just one person. There are many of us, and we all have voices. But more than that, we have resources, experience, and passion."
5.7327E+17,Non-offensive,You aren't alone in this. You're never alone in this.
5.7327E+17,Non-offensive,"We have seen so many fantastic things happen out of this tragedy. First, we have @femfreq. Amazing advocacy. A voice that is far reaching."
5.73271E+17,Non-offensive,"We have @crashoverridenw, an invaluable resource that provides emotional support for targets of harassment."
5.73271E+17,Non-offensive,Both of these organizations have been created to address different aspects of very real problems that affect all of us.
